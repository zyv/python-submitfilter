Sample TORQUE submission filter script in Python

From TORQUE documentation:

- Command line arguments passed to qsub are passed as arguments to the submit
  filter (filter wonâ€™t see them in STDIN) in the same order and may be used as
  needed.

- Exit status of -1 will cause qsub to reject the submission with a message
  stating that it failed due to administrative policies.
